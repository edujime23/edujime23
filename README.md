## Introduction

Hello! My name is EduJime23, and I'm an amateur programmer with 5 years of experience using Python, JS, HTML, and CSS. I'm passionate about coding because I love creating complex, useful, or fun things. I'm also interested in learning how to make AIs, making low level projects with ASM, C, C++ or Rust.

## Programming Experience

One of my favorite projects is websites. I've also worked on several web development projects using HTML, CSS, and JS. I'm comfortable with front-end development.

## Skills

## Future Goals

In the future, I hope to continue improving my coding skills and learning new technologies. I'm particularly interested learning Rust, C++ and ASM.

Thanks for reading!
